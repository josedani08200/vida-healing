                Family Therapy is a type of counseling that can help family
                members improve communication and resolve conflicts. At times,
                family therapy is necessary to address family struggles and heal
                a familyâ€™s wounds. At Vida Healing, we strive to offer families
                a way to do this in a safe, comfortable, and professional
                environment. We will assist in developing a plan for maintaining
                a healthy, functional family. Whether you are new parents,
                recently separated or divorced, and/or trying to manage the
                curve balls that come with raising a teenager, we are here to
                assist. Our goal is to establish strong communication skills and
                create a stronger and healthier family.
